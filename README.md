## repository
This is a web directory based chocolatey repository. It includes a packages.config file that points to various nupkg files in the directory tree.
This file can be scraped by a modified [chocolatey](https://github.com/bennyhat/chocolatey) to cache the nupkg files locally.

The nupkg files themselves are generated by a quick crawlers script, called packageAll.ps1, which can be run to pack all the packages up, per their nuspec files.

```shell
> Powershell .\packageAll.ps1
```
